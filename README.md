##  Keylogging

Keylogging involves the creation of a tool that tracks and records keystrokes typed on a device's keyboard. This tool helps monitor user activity and can be used to capture sensitive information such as passwords, email content, or personal notes. Itâ€™s a basic to1.ol for understanding how unauthorized access can occur in an operating system.

    Key Features:
        Tracks every key pressed by the user.
        Stores log files for later analysis.
        Can potentially record mouse movements and clicks.
    Skills Required:
        Basic programming knowledge.
        Understanding of operating systems and how they handle input.
    Tools Required:
        Programming languages like Python or C++.
        Keylogging libraries and modules.
    Applications:
        Educational tool to understand how keylogging works.
        Used for security testing (e.g., monitoring for unauthorized activity).

Keylogger Project

Project Overview

In today's dynamic business landscape, organizations face the constant challenge of securing their sensitive information against cyber threats and data breaches. Our Advanced Keylogger project aims to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive tool for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities within computer systems.
Introduction

In modern business operations heavily reliant on computer systems, the threat of cyber-attacks is a critical concern. Our Advanced Keylogger serves as a proactive defense mechanism, designed to monitor employee activities and detect potential security threats. It goes beyond traditional keyloggers by capturing various types of information, including keystrokes, screenshots, application logs, and system logs.

#  Features

  . Captures Keystrokes: Our system records keystrokes for detailed analysis.
  . Screenshots Capture: Capture screenshots for a visual record of user activity.
  . Application Logs: Collect logs generated by applications for comprehensive insights.
  . System Logs: Record system logs to analyze system-level activities.
